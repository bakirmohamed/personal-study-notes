# How to build a framework ? 
- Model size and complexity
- Training data quality and diversity
- Bias and fairness
- Ethical considerations and Responsible use
- Fine tuning and transfer learning
- Explainability and tracebility
- Robustness and adversial attacks
- Continuous monitoring and improvement
​
# Evaluation methods
- Embedding based : BertScore, MoverScore, WEAT
- Language based : NLI Score, BLEURT, QAQG Score
- LLM assisted : RAGAS, ArizeAI, GPT-score, G-eval
- Word based : Roaje, BLEU, WER, Meteor
- Character based :  EditDistance
